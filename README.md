# An approximation theory framework for Measure Transport Sampling Algorithms

This repository numerically studies the convergence rates for approximating transport maps in higher-dimensional function spaces using different metrics and divergences. We study the approximation of one-dimensional maps using the Wasserstein distance between push-forward measures and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between pull-back measures. The code for minimizing the KL divergence over a space of monotone maps relies on the toolbox developed as part of the ATM package that is available [here](https://github.com/baptistar/ATM). More details on the experiments and the theoretical analysis for these studies can be found in the accompanying preprint.
